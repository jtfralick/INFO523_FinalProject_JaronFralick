# INFO523_FinalProject_JaronFralick
This repo contains the code for my final project for INFO 523
All of the code for this project was written in Python
I have included .ipynb and .py versions for each code file

The file titled "INFO523_final_project_Jaron_F" contains all of the code for 
performing principal component analysis on the four datasets used in this project.

The data for this project is located in the links below:

“Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.” UCI Machine Learning Repository: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29. 

“Iris Data Set.” UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml//datasets/Iris. 

“Wine Data Set.” UCI Machine Learning Repository: Wine Data Set, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml//datasets/Wine. 

“Heart Disease Data Set.” UCI Machine Learning Repository: Heart Disease Data Set, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml//datasets/Heart+Disease. 

The files titled "breast_cancer_MLP_with_PCA" and "breast_cancer_MLP_without_PCA" are the multilayer
perceptron machine learning models used on the breast cancer data set with and without applying PCA to the data set, respectively.
